    <h2>In-Person Lessons at the Mount Vernon Public Library</h2>
    <p>  
      This is the perfect begginer class for students curious about technology and computers! We use Scratch, a free block based coding
      language developed by MIT to teach coding fundamentals. We start out with a seemingly simple question: What does it mean to code? 
      We approach coding as a way to communicate with computers. A chain of code is like a set of instructions. Each block of code has a specific function
      and when put together, they create a program. 
     
      This is a project based class. Every lesson, students are assigned a project to work on
      depending on their skill level. Projects begin simple, like making a sprite walk in a the shape of a square. 
      As students progress, projects become more complex. By the end of the 4th lesson, 
      students are able to design a game that incoorporates moving with arrow keys, 
      keeping score, multiple charachters and switching backgrounds. 

      This is treated as a drop-in course. There are students that attend weekly, biweekly, and sometimes more sporatically. 
      In this course, we tailor material to each students skill level. Though there is a short presentatoin at the start of each class for weekly students 
      that introduces and teaches a new concept, the bulk of class time is spent working on projects with one - on - one help from the instructor. 

     Note: For in-person lessons at the Mount Vernon Public Library, computers are provided the library.
